# About

I'm currently a Data Science intern with [DIME at the World Bank](https://www.worldbank.org/en/research/dime), where I work on data collection and analysis for the [DE JURE portfolio](http://pubdocs.worldbank.org/en/344481492116191011/DEJURE-One-Pager-2017-04-13.pdf).

As of 2018, I've been a grad student in the [Computational Analysis & Public Policy](https://capp.uchicago.edu/) (CAPP) program at the University of Chicago. My research interests lie in the applications of machine learning to unstructured and novel data sources, particularly in developing and low-resource contexts.

Previously, I've worked on impact evaluation and database management for [Pencils of Promise](https://pencilsofpromise.org/). I've also interned at [charity: water](https://www.charitywater.org/), [BRAC USA](https://www.bracusa.org/), the [International Crisis Group](https://www.crisisgroup.org/), and the [Ministry of Foreign Affairs](https://www.mfa.gov.sg/) in Singapore.
